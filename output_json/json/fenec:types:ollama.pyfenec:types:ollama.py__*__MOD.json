    "summary": "This code snippet imports the `Message` class from the `ollama` module, renaming it to `OllamaMessage` for use within the local scope. The primary purpose of this import is to utilize the messaging functionalities provided by the `ollama` library, which is likely a specialized framework designed for handling complex communication tasks within a larger application. The key component here is the `OllamaMessage` class, which is expected to encapsulate methods and attributes necessary for creating, sending, or managing messages. This class likely employs object-oriented design patterns, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to provide a robust interface for message handling operations. Although the implementation details are not explicit in this snippet, the import suggests that `OllamaMessage` is central to the messaging operations, potentially involving methods for message construction, serialization, and dispatching.\n\nThe technical stack is primarily centered around the `ollama` library, which serves as the backbone for messaging functionalities. This library might include additional components or dependencies that facilitate communication protocols, data serialization, or network communication, although these are not visible in the snippet. In the context of a larger system, this import statement indicates that the code is part of a module or application that requires advanced messaging capabilities. It likely interacts with other components responsible for communication, data exchange, or user notifications, suggesting a role in a distributed system or a microservices architecture where messaging is a critical component. The `ollama` library's role is crucial in providing the necessary infrastructure for these operations, enabling seamless integration and communication between different parts of the system. This import is a foundational element in ensuring that the application can handle messaging tasks efficiently and effectively, contributing to the overall functionality and reliability of the system.",
