    "summary": "This code snippet is designed to initiate and manage an interactive chat session with a system named Fenec, serving as a command-line interface for user communication. The primary purpose of the code is to facilitate a continuous dialogue between the user and the Fenec system, allowing users to input commands or queries until they choose to exit the session. Key components include the `chat_loop` function, which is responsible for managing the chat session lifecycle, and the use of the `typer` library for command-line interaction, specifically for prompting user input and handling errors. The implementation involves a simple loop that continuously prompts the user for input using `typer.prompt` and checks for the termination command 'exit' to break the loop. Error handling is implemented using `typer.echo` to display error messages and `typer.Exit` to terminate the program if the Fenec instance is not initialized, ensuring that the chat session only starts if the codebase has been processed. The technical stack primarily includes the `typer` library, which is utilized for building command-line interfaces, providing functionalities like prompting and error messaging. In the context of a larger system, this code acts as a user interface component, likely interacting with a backend system or service represented by the Fenec instance. It assumes the existence of a processed codebase, indicating its role in a broader application where codebase processing is a prerequisite for chat functionality. This snippet fits into a larger project by serving as the user-facing entry point for interacting with the Fenec system, potentially interfacing with other components that handle codebase processing, data retrieval, or response generation, thus playing a crucial role in the user experience and system accessibility.",
